# UpDash
An easy wrapper for [the Up API](https://developer.up.com.au).

I want to use this to make a dashboard to track my saving and 
spending.

## Quickstart
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
```sh
python -m venv .venv
```
2. Get your Up API access key and set the `$UPDASH_ACCESS_TOKEN`
environment variable (you can also achieve this by making a 
`.env` file in the root directory)
3. Install dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the program
```sh
python -m updash
```
